Candy Crush Game
This project is a simplified web version of the popular Candy Crush game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game dynamically generates a grid of candies that players can drag and drop to match candies of the same color. When a row or column of three or more matching candies is formed, they are cleared from the board, and the player scores points. The empty spaces are then filled with new candies that fall from the top.

Features
-Interactive Grid: The game consists of an 8x8 grid filled with colorful candy icons.
-Drag and Drop Functionality: Players can drag and swap candies with adjacent ones to form matches.
-Match-3 Logic: The game automatically checks for matches of three or more candies in both rows and columns.
-Score Tracking: The player's score increases each time a match of three or more candies is made.
-Automatic Candy Drop: After candies are cleared, new candies automatically fall into place from above to fill the empty slots.
-Four-Candy Bonus: The game detects matches of four candies in a row or column for a higher score.
